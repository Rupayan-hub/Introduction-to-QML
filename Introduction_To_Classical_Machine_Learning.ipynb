In simple words, it’s the science of getting computers to learn & act as humans do, and improve their leaning over time in an autonomous way without the need of anyone else. Though machine learning is the field of computer science, it different from classical computational approaches."

    "Can instruments actually be intelligent? Or just run the machine until it works according to human instructions. In 1936, Allen Turing came up with the idea of the Turing test to answer the question of machine intelligence. Turing suggests that artificial learning agents can learn on their own learning machine theory. Inspired by Turing theory, later genetic algorithms were developed. In 1913, a few years before Turing, Andrei Markov incarnated the Markov chain theory. Markov decision processes are used in reinforcement learning.\n",

    "In 1943, Warren McCluch and Walter Pitts attempted to create artificial neural networks using artificial neurons, imitating the structure of neurons in the human brain. They basically try to implement the mathematical model of neural networks through electrical circuits. Based on their efforts, in 1950, Dean Edmund and another scientist created the first neural network that could learn on its own. However, In 1952, Arthur Samuel was the first to create a machine learning program that could play checker games on IBM computers. He later coined the term machine learning in 1959.\n"

    "Supervised Learning- Supervised learning is teaching like a human child. In supervised learning the machine is taught by example with label dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning- The machine learns from un-labeled data. Means, there is no correct answer given to the machine to learn, but the machine must hopefully find patterns from the data to come up with an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning- It can be mixed of supervised & unsupervised learning techniques. As some data is labelled & most of it is unlabeled.\n",

    "In here we can notice that how quantum computing and machine learning meet, we could think of the input and/or the processing part being classical or quantum giving four combinations. If both are classical, we have classical machine learning. Classical ma-chine  learning can be used to support quantum computing, for example in quantum error correction Quantum processes can  also be used as an inspiration for classical algorithms, such as tensor networks, simulated annealing and in optimization. If the input is a quantum state and the computing is classical, the machine learning routine is used to translate quantum information into classical information. If both the input and processing are quantum, this will be real quantum machine learning, however, only a few results in this direction are published yet. In most quantum machine learning research, however, the focus is on the fourth case where the input contains classical in-formation and processing is quantum.\n"

With Quantum Computing, we've reached the pinnacle of computer technology that defies logic as well as imagination. The transistors used in today's computers are so small that they can be made with the technology at hand. So computer inventors have begun to look for possible solutions at the nuclear and ultra-atomic levels, known as quantum computing."
